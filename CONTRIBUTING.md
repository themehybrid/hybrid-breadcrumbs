# Contributing

The code for this project is handled via its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/themehybrid/hybrid-breadcrumbs).  You can open tickets, create patches, and send pull requests there.

## Pull requests

Problem first.  Solution second.

Pull requests should have a ticket open for discussion first.  I rarely accept pull requests that aren't for a specific issue for various reasons.  It's far better to post an issue and let me or the community provide feedback prior to creating a pull request.

Please don't make pull requests against the `master` branch.  This is the latest, stable code.  You can make a pull request against one of the point branches.

## Coding standards

This project follows a mixture of the following standards.

- [PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1)
- [PSR-2: Coding Style](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
- [PSR-4: Autoloading Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4)
- [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards)

There are instances where I opt for personal choices of my own.  In terms of contributing, stick to the standard you're most familiar with or fall back to the WordPress coding standards.  I'll make any adjustments later if the need arises.

## Language
