# Hybrid\\Breadcrumbs

Hybrid Breadcrumbs is a drop-in package that theme authors can use to add breadcrumbs to their WordPress themes.

The package is a developer-friendly project that aims to take out all the work of handling breadcrumbs. It is one of the most advanced and robust breadcrumb systems available that can handle nearly any setup to show the most accurate breadcrumbs for each page.

This project was [originally launched in 2009](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/04/05/breadcrumb-trail-wordpress-plugin) as the Breadcrumb Trail plugin. Hybrid Breadcrumbs is a reimagining of that original script as a better drop-in package for theme authors to use.

## Requirements

* WordPress 4.9+.
* PHP 7.4+ (preferably 8+).
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing PHP dependencies.

## Documentation

The following docs are written with theme authors in mind because that'll be the most common use case.  If including in a plugin, it shouldn't be much different.

### Installation

First, you'll need to open your command line tool and change directories to your theme folder.

```bash
cd path/to/wp-content/themes/<your-theme-name>
```

Then, use Composer to install the package.

```bash
composer require themehybrid/hybrid-breadcrumbs
```

Assuming you're not already including the Composer autoload file for your theme and are shipping this as part of your theme package, you'll want something like the following bit of code in your theme's `functions.php` to autoload this package (and any others).

The Composer autoload file will automatically load up Hybrid Breadcrumbs for you and make its code available for you to use.

```php
if ( file_exists( get_parent_theme_file_path( 'vendor/autoload.php' ) ) ) {
	require_once( get_parent_theme_file_path( 'vendor/autoload.php' ) );
}
```

### Translations

Because this script has a few internationalized text strings within it, you'll want to overwrite the textdomain or use something like this [one theme with two textdomains trick](https://gist.github.com/justintadlock/7a605c29ae26c80878d0) (the textdomain in this project is `'hybrid-core'`).

If you're creating a theme using the [Hybrid Core framework](https://github.com/themehybrid/hybrid-core), you don't have to worry about this. Hybrid Core will appropriately handle translations for you.

### Usage

Most developers will want to utilize the `Hybrid\Breadrumbs\Trail` class.  It is a static wrapper class that essentially acts as _syntactic sugar_ for use in theme templates.

Typically, a call like the following would go into your theme's `header.php` template but can be used anywhere you want to show the breadcrumb trail.

```php
Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\Trail::display();
```

_Note that the plugin's namespace is `Hybrid\Breadcrumbs`.  If you're working within another namespace, you'll want to add a `use` statement after your own namespace call or call `\Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\Trail::display()` directly.  I'll assume you know what you're doing if you're working with namespaces.  Otherwise, stick to the above._

### Static class

The `Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\Trail` class has the following methods:

```php
// Returns a new instance of the Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\Breadcrumbs class.
Trail::breadcrumbs( array $args = [] );

// Makes a breadcrumb trail and returns an instance of the Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\Breadcrumbs.
Trail::make( array $args = [] );

// Returns an array of Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\Crumb\* objects.
Trail::all( array $args = [] );

// Displays the HTML output of the breadcrumb trail if it exists.
Trail::display( array $args = [] );

// Returns the HTML output of the breadcrumb trail or an empty string.
Trail::render( array $args = [] );
```

### Breadcrumbs class

If you don't care for static classes and need to work directly with the object, that's fine too.  You can create and use a the `Breadcrumbs` object like so:

```php
// Create a new Breadcrumbs object.
$trail = new \Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\Breadcrumbs( array $args = [] );

// Makes the breadcrumb trail and returns an instance of the object.
$trail->make();

// Returns an array of Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\Crumb\* objects.
$trail->all();

// Displays the HTML output of the breadcrumb trail if it exists.
$trail->display();

// Returns the HTML output of the breadcrumb trail or an empty string.
$trail->render();
```

### Parameters

The `Breadcrumbs` class and the `Trail` class methods all accept a single parameter, which an array of optional arguments for setting up the breadcrumb trail.  The following is a list of all the available options (see below for defaults).

* `labels` - An array of labels.

```php
$defaults = [
	'post' => 'category'
];
```
